# Leaflet Bundle

[`Leaflet`](https://leafletjs.com/) 

[`Leaflet on Github`](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet) 

This is no way intended to take away from or replace Leaflet and will always be synced with Leaflet's LTS version.

## Why
Got tired of manually patching paths and dealing with dead plugin projects and wanted a consolidated repo.
- Moved images to /content/img
